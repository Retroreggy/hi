<H2><i>David Matheson</i></A> - <font size=3> (guitar, accordion, piano)</font></h2> 

<p>David Matheson also answers to Dave, Dave-o, Mr. Cheese, and--a 
title with a bit more distinction--the King of Spain.  Born 
February 17<!, 1966>, Dave is reputed to have been able to play an 
accordian before he could walk.  His instrumental repertoire also 
includes--but likely isn't limited to--guitar, percussion, 
keyboard, and the notoriously untuneable banjo.  And don't let that 
calm, laid-back demeanor fool you: underneath lurks an unrepentant 
and irrepressible punster!

<br><H2><i>Mike Ford</i></A> - <font size=3> (guitar, percussion, piano)</font></H2>

<P>If Dave is the punster, Michael Ford may well be the pundit of the 
group.  He's quite the old hand at this performing gig, senior to 
the others by a few years (born September 27<!, 1962>), and a married 
man (to Terri, on May 11, 1996).  All innovation and no inhibition 
on stage, Mike's alter-ego credits also include Spiderman, Grampa 
Fr&uuml;vous, and Lou Reed.  Of the four Fr&uuml;lads, he's probably the most 
liable to leap from the stage to tango with his audience, craft a 
new song to an old folk melody, or regale the crowd with a few 
lines in Francais.  His instruments of choice include guitar, 
harmonica, keyboard, drums, and the megaphone.

<br><H2><i>Jian Ghomeshi</i></A> - <font size=3> (drums, percussion, tin whistle)</font></H2>

<P>Jian Ghomeshi (pronounced 'ZHEE-on go-MESH-ee') 
is given to wearing his heart on his sleeve--or at 
least his passions on his chest, with provocative slogans and bon 
mots on his shirts.  He's primus inter pares when it comes to 
discoursing on social and political issues with the audience, 
especially concerning Fr&uuml;vous' home province of Ontario.  He's also 
likely to break into anything from snippets of musicals to lounge 
music to Beatles classics.  You might find him relatively 
stationary at his drum set or playing guitar or tin whistle, but in 
the a cappella songs--and particularly as Sam-I-Am--he'll be dashing 
about the stage, exhorting the audience to sing and dance along.
He was born on June 9<!, 1967> to a family of Iranian heritage.

<br><H2><i>Murray Foster</i></A> - <font size=3> (bass)</font></H2>

<P>Murray Foster, sometimes dubbed Mur or the Mur-man, is the master 
of the low end.  He'll occasionally take on the guitar or 
percussion, but he's far more likely to be playing bass, and it's 
his rich bass voice rounding out the vocal harmonies.  He brings up 
the pack, age-wise, with his birthday on June 29<!, 1967>.  Given to 
the pithy comment and the wry chuckle, Murray often seems somewhat 
like a stabilizing factor when Fr&uuml;vous' antics and impromptu jams 
drift a bit far from the set list.  In fact, you might think of 
Murray as the anchor of the group--at least, until he throws his 
bass in the air.

<p>Adding validity to the expression, "you have to watch out for the quiet ones," is Colin "Cal" Stanutz. Born
July 27<!, 1964>, Cal is making his 2nd tour of duty with the Fr&uuml;lads as their Front of House Mixer, general
sound guru and scoth connoisseur. Always a professional at shows, the man with the constantly changing hair
color can be found turning dials behind the soundboard or making occasional onstage appearances to adjust
instruments and microphones. With a sharp mind and good spirit, Cal's a great person to talk to on any subject,
a killer at crossword puzzles and willing to help fr&uuml;heads with audio tech questions. If there's a problem
to be solved, Cal's the one you want handling it.

<br><H2><i>Dave Tobey</i></A> - <font size=3> (Tour Manager)</font></H2>

<P>This Peterborough, Ontario native with exceptionally-long brown hair is most commonly known as "Tobey" to
avoid confusion with the bald banjo player in the band. Working as the Moxy Fr&uuml;vous tour manager, you can find
him ensconced behind the merch table at any show, always willing to hand out Fr&uuml;miles stamps, hugs and helpful
advice. Sugar addicts, be forewarned! Although he doesn't drink or smoke, he will admit to a serious Pez addiction
and, in fact, is quite the Pez pusher. While he plays on offstage role with Moxy Fr&uuml;vous, he is a performer
in his own right with his own band Pitchfork. As your manager, Tobey is the details man, ensuring things run
smoothly at venues, doring most of the Fr&uuml;bus driving and greeting fans with an ever-present warmth. Tobey
was born on April 10<!, 1970>. This is also the day the Beatles broke up. We're sure it's just coincedence.

<P>If you have a question about t-shirts or tour dates and call Fr&uuml;vous Headquarters, the friendly voice
on the end of the line is Jude Coombe. If you're lucky, you'll get the chance to meet the always-smiling Jude
at the occasional show helping out behind the merch table. A Fr&uuml;vous supporter from before the Bargainville
days, Jude started working with the band in March of 1997. She's a huge supporter of Canadian music, and loves
to see live shows every night of the week! So, look for her when you're out and about in Toronto.

<P><font size=4><b>Band bio:</b></font>

<P><i>The following was originally written by Sharilyn 
Johnson and Chris O'Malley, and was then compiled, edited, 
and supplemented by Colleen Campbell (thanks Cee!):</i>

<P><i>Updated on 8/29/99 by Chad Maloney:</i>
     
<P>Think back a few years. The 80's have ended: college graduates are
beginning to be confronted with the fact that a degree does not equal a
job; a new form of music, call it "alternative" or "progressive" as you
will, is seeping up from the ranks of the disgruntled garage-band
musicians. Perhaps in response to trends such as these, perhaps to bring
in some extra pocket money, and perhaps just for a lark, four young men
formed a band and took to the streets of Ontario for some busking. Thus
was born Moxy Früvous. 

<P>In 1990, Mike Ford, Murray Foster, Dave Matheson, and Jian Ghomeshi were
neither novices to the world of music nor strangers to each other. They
knew each other from attending Thornlea Secondary School in Thornhill (a
suburb of Toronto), from theater classes in high school, and from
various musical projects. Jian and Murray had been in a mid-80's new
wave band, <a href="http://www.canoe.ca/JamMusicPopEncycloPagesT/tall_new_buildings.html">Tall New Buildings</a>; 
they were joined by Mike (to create The
Chia Pets, which played covers at weddings and the like) and later by
Dave. 

<P>Moxy Früvous frequented Harbourfront and the Bloor St. Cinema on the
weekends, often playing three 20-minute sets in an afternoon and drawing
crowds of a couple hundred people with their antics. Their music was
catchy, somewhat extemporaneous, and driven by their vocals, keeping
instrumentation to a minimum. As legend has it, one afternoon a producer
from CBC radio grabbed them to perform on "Later the Same Day," a
drive-home show. Früvous became regulars on the show and were
commissioned to write short satirical songs about local issues. From
these came "My Baby Loves a Bunch of Authors" (for the authors' festival
in Toronto) and "The Gulf War Song"; but most were what Früvous calls
"short shelf-life songs." 

<P>Früvous began playing indoors in the summer of 1991. In early 1992, they
decided to release an independently-produced cassette. They printed only
a thousand opies, originally believing it was for their friends and
family that they were producing it. Over fifty-thousand copies of the
cassette and a year's worth of placing on the Canadian Independent
Charts changed their minds. They toured across Canada, promoting their
cassette and winning a CASBY award for Favorite New Group. Offers, of
course, came pouring in from record labels, and they opened for
performers like Bob Dylan and the Barenaked Ladies. 

<P>Früvous signed a five-album contract with Warner Music Canada, with
releases in the U.S. by Atlantic Records (an agreement no longer in
effect). The first of these to be released was "Bargainville," a
fifteen-track album which included recordings of five of the six songs
from the independent cassette. It was an immediate success: the first
single, "Stuck in the 90's," hit the top ten in radio and video, and the
album went platinum. Früvous took to the road again in the fall of 1993
on the Bargainville Tour, touring across Canada and down into the U.S.
in early 1994, where "Bargainville" was being released. 

<P>Moxy Früvous has maintained an extremely busy tour schedule for most of
the time since, extending their range to regularly include the
northeastern and midwestern U.S. They played Europe in the summer of
1994, hitting England, Scotland, and Denmark, and returning for engagements in
the next couple summers, including the prestigious WOMAD festival in
1996. For the first time in years, they ventured to Western Canada and
down the West Coast of the US in 1998 and have included those areas in
their 1999 touring schedule as well.

<P>Früvous took a break from touring in early 1995, heading back to the
recording studio. The result was an album more rich and dense in
instrumentation--most of which the band played themselves, with guest
Danny Levin appearing as violinist on several tracks. The songs were
more personal to the band, and most of their fans considered the work a
distinct break from "Bargainville." The Canadian release of "Wood" was
not followed by a release in the U.S., and for this reason, the band
became disenchanted with the performance of Atlantic Records. A year
after "Wood" was recorded, Früvous produced an independent EP, "The B
Album," which they describe as a collection of unreleased "satirical
bits and oddities" culled from their work from 1990 onward. "The B
Album" features short works with inobtrusive or no instrumentation; it
was picked up by Warner in Canada after some success with primarily
self-promotion by the band.

<P>They resumed their fast-paced tour schedule immediately after
recording "The B Album," finally breaking in November of 1996 to record
their third full-length album, "You Will Go to the Moon."
Unsurprisingly, it is also an album of experiments and surprises, new
instruments and the constant challenge to explore uncharted musical
terra. In the U.S., "You Will Go to the Moon" was the first release of
fledgling indie label Bottom Line Records. Bottom Line also rereleased
"Wood" and "The B Album" in the United States in 1998, making those
albums widely available there for the first time.

<P>Früvous still considers their live show to be the backbone of their
success as a group--and anyone who has seen them perform is likely to
agree. Always innovative, easy-going, and highly responsive to their
audiences, they indulge themselves in banter and quipping on stage,
break out into impromptu and improvisational songs, freely switch among
the several instruments (many unconventional) that each plays, and
establish a rapport with their audiences. It's therefore no surprise
that their next album was an attempt to capture the energy and joie de vivre of their shows. Recorded at six
shows (and throwing in tidbits from a couple more) during their fall '97
tour, released in the spring of '98, and greeted enthusiastically
by fans and critics alike, "Live Noise" was finally the album that
showcases most of what makes Früvous the unique band they are. Bottom
Line Records had enlisted the help of BMG in distributing "Live Noise"
more broadly in America, so for the first time, fans in the U.S. and in
Canada could locate a Früvous album with equal ease on the shelves of
their major music outlets. Having access to a concert in the CD player
won't make them any more blase about attending as many shows as
possible, though. Their fans are just as enthralled to see the Lads up
close and personal as they were back in the days when Früvous was
playing on the streets of Toronto for pocket change. 

<P>Continuing the musical adventure that is Moxy Fruvous, the band
proceeded to break out new material at their live shows starting
in April of 1998. In preparation for their next full-length release, the
band test drove more than 14 new songs in front of audiences across the
United States and Canada. Entering the studio in March of 1999, they
recorded with producer Don Dixon. 12 of the recorded tracks were chosen
as a package. The result was "Thornhill", an album showcasing the
influences that the times and music had on the four members of Moxy
Fruvous while growing up in that suburb of Toronto. With a new flourish
of publicity in and around Toronto, the album was released in August of
1999. In the United States, the album was released on Bottom Line
Records. With their Warner Canada contract up after 5 albums, the group
released "Thornhill" in Canada on True North records.
